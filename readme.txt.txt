The Attention Network Task (Fan et al. 2002)
--------------------------------------------

The Attention Network Test (ANT) is designed to measure 3 attention networks that 
have been defined in both anatomical and functional terms; the alerting, orienting and 
executive control networks. The ANT can be performed within a single 30-min testing session
that can be easily performed by children, patients, and monkeys.

The task involves participants responding to the direction of both cued (spatially or not) and uncued 
centre arrow targets that are flanked by congruent, incongruent or neutral stimuli. The cue types measure
how alerting or orienting attention networks are employed, and the flanker types measure the ability 
to resolve conflict from visual stimuli.
